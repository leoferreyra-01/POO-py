## 🎯 Overview

This project contains multiple exercises and examples to help you learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python. Each folder contains different exercises focusing on specific OOP concepts.

## 📚 Available Exercises

### 1. Classes and Objects (`1-Classes and Objects/`)
- **File**: `main.py`
- **Focus**: Basic class definition and object creation
- **Concepts**: Classes, objects, attributes, methods

### 2. Constructor (`2-Constructor/`)
- **Files**: `grades.py`, `main.py`
- **Focus**: Constructor methods and practical application
- **Concepts**: `__init__` method, parameter validation, interactive applications

#### Student Grade Management System
The main exercise in this section is a complete student grade management system that demonstrates:
- Class constructors with validation
- Data encapsulation
- Method implementation
- User input handling
- Error management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer
- Basic understanding of Python syntax

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
```bash
# If using Git:

# Or download and extract the ZIP file to your desired location
```

#### Step 2: Verify Python Installation
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```
You should see Python 3.6 or higher.

#### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd POO-py
```

#### Step 4: Choose an Exercise to Practice

**Option A: Start with Basic Classes and Objects**
```bash
cd "1-Clases y objetos"
python main.py
```

**Option B: Practice with Constructor Exercise**
```bash
cd "2-Constructor"
python grades.py
```
